# Push Notifications

Push notifications are messages sent directly to a user's device by the SeatBoost service, even when the user is not actively using the app. These alerts appear on the home screen or in the notification center and can include text, images, or interactive elements. They are designed to engage users by providing timely updates, reminders, or other important information. Unlike traditional SMS messages, push notifications are associated with specific app and require user permission.

SeatBoost service has the ability to send some push notifications (auction updated, flight updated, participant removed, etc) to the app using SeatBoost SDK keeping users informed and engaged, enhancing the overall user experience with real-time communication.

The SeatBoost service implements push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), a powerful cross-platform messaging solution by Google. Please, follow the steps below in order to have SeatBoost push notifications implemented in your app.
